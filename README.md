Digital Flash - Portable Flashcards for Students 
================================================

Digital Flash is a web application for students to study vocabulary.  Users can create stacks of cards in three different ways.  The first way the user will search through the applicationâ€™s predefined terms.  The user will be able to sort through the words by defining the first letter of the word per by typing in a text box for the word and, as they type, the results will be narrowed (similar to Google Instant).

The second way the user can create a stack is by manually adding vocabulary words.  When the user chooses this option, two text boxes will appear.  The user will then enter the term then the definition in the next box.  When the user confirms this information, it will be added to the stack.

The third way is a feature for those who just want to brush up on general vocabulary.  There will be a button to create a random stack of words.
